- make common.c
	- current_usecs
	- get_ioaddr and phys_addr and remote_ioaddr
	- validate_buffer (which is host memory)
	- get_value (which also does srand etc)
	- move SCIGetErrorString from reporting.c to here

- reporting.c
	- make verbosity levels an enum instead

- rename local.cu to gpu.cu
	- make validate_gpu_buffer call validate_buffer after all magic stuff
	- change call to log_ioaddr to get ioaddr and do log_debug instead
	- change make_local_segment to make_gpu_segment

- make program accept --gpu argument as optional instead, if not given make segment in ram

- benchmark write and read from remote segment (by mapping it)
	- for (i = 0; i < len; ++i) remote[i] = local[i] // and vice versa
	- scimemcpy
	- scimemwrite
	
- make program accept --mode=dma [default and alias for scidma], --mode=read, --mode=write, --mode=sciwrite, --mode=scimemcpy
	- change dma_mode_t to bench_mode_t and alter values

- make defines in common.h in Makefile instead

- make ram.c
	- make_ram_segment (make local segment in ram and similar functions, make_ram_buffer etc)

- make data-interrupt to pass value that's supposed to be stored in buffer

- restructure bench.c and main.cu, move benchmarking functionality out from main.cu but avoid making extremely long argument lists
