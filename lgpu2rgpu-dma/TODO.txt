1) Make client only output buffer on reads and only trigger interrupt on writes

2) Make buffer output and verification optional --verify (needs "re-lettering"
   for args)

3) Restructure repo, give everything new names, rewrite lgpu2lgpu-p2p to be
   stand-alone and delete shared

4) Add more fine-grained control to benchmarking, make it report latency as
   well
   	- benchmark result (bench_result_t) containing test parameters?
	- report_bandwidth()
	- report_latency()

5) Implement more benchmark modes

6) Go through source code and be more consistent in naming and in comments and
   argument passing
	- bench_mode_t => bench_op_t, operation
	- int translist_info(translist_info_t* info);
	- buffer => buf ?
	- pointer => ptr ?
	- device => dev ?
	- physical mem / ioaddr / device mem
	- mem ptr vs buf ptr etc

7) make GPU descriptor type? or GPU memory descriptor type?
